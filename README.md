## Transaction Flow
Writing a brief description because the way transactions are sent around app is not apparent. Transactions originate from some place (new, modified, or removed). This is from Plaid, add-transaction-component, transaction-sorter-component, and possibly more in the future. The classes that created these events publish them to the TransactionPublisher. Classes that would like to stay updated with transaction changes (ex tab1) should implement the ITransactionSubscriber. They can then receive these new transactions. TransactionService is responsible for listening to these and adding them to DB. Tab1 simply updates it's transactions and financial data.
